This folder is meant to hold .mhf files which serve to apply a certain hack/mod/ASM feature to a ROM.
You can apply these patches by opening the "Patch Editor" in Emblem Magic.
Some ASM hacks are bundled with Emblem Magic by default:
- Anti-Huffman Text Patch:
	Allows for easy text insertion by making the game recognize certain pointers as uncompressed ASCII text.
	Currently, having this patch applied is the only way to insert text into ROMhacks with Emblem Magic.
- Str/Mag Split:
	Splits the "Str" strength stat into two separate stats: "Str" for physical strength, and "Mag" magic power.
	This difference in the unit stat system is present in the older games in the Fire Emblem series.
