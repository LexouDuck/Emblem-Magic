	<h1>Hexadecimal</h1>
	<p>
	Hexadecimal is a numbering system. Decimal is the one we are used to, and binary is another example of a numbering system useful for computing. Actually, to be precise, binary is a numbering system <i>necessary</i> for computing.<br>
	Whereas the decimal system starts representing numbers with two digits from 10 onwards (and 3-digit numbers from 10 * 10 = 100 onwards)- hexadecimal has more symbols, so as to switch to 2 digits at 16 (and 3 digits at 16 * 16 = 256).
	<br>
	<br>
	Hexadecimal values are typically prefixed with "0x" or "$" to let you know that they are in hex, although most of the numeric controls in Emblem Magic show numbers without prefixes. Hexadecimal values used in computing usually have set digit lengths, it is not unusual to see "0"s appended to the number so as to have a correct digit length.

	<br>
	Since a single hex digit (from '0' to 'F') is a number between 0 and 15, a hex digit has the same number range as 4 binary bits. As such, what hexadecimal notation allows is to represent a byte with only two characters: since a byte is essentially an 8-bit binary number (ranging from 0 to 255), it can be shown in hex as a number ranging from 0x00 to 0xFF, rather than as a confusing sequence of 0s and 1s.
