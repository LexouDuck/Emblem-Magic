-------------------------------------------------
-----------Basic language abilities--------------
-------------------------------------------------

Comments:
 /**/ = Ingores everything between the **'s.
  Example: 
   MNCH /*Coment!!!11!!*/ 0x55 
  will look the same to the assembler as:
   MNCH 0x55  
  The comments can be nested, meaning /*Co /*mm*/ ent*/ will be
  commented out completely.

 // = Ingores the rest of the line
  Example:
   MNCH 0x55 //lol commentz!!11!! noob, ?!?!?!?!??!?!??!??! orly stfu u suck
  will look the same to the assembler as:
   MNCH 0x55

Using labels: 
 If the first word of a lines ends with :, it is considered to 
 be a label. A label can be followed by normal code. The part 
 before : is the labels name. Example:
  randomName:
 Label can be used in the code by placing it's name as the pointer 
 parameter. Example:
  POIN randomName

Hex/dec/bin numbers.
 Hex number must ALWAYS start with either 0x or $. Binary numbers
 end with b or B. Othervise, the number will be interpretetted 
 as dec. Letters in dec numbers will cause errors and values other than
 0 and 1 will cause errors bin numbers. 0x and $ are the same unless 
 specified othervise. 

Several codes on one line lines:
 Adding ; to somewhere to a line will make assembler consider
 the text after ; as a new code instead of parameters of the old code.
 Note that line can have as many ; as you want.

Arithmetics aka calculating aka math:
 The following operations are supported:
 +, -, *, /, %, &, |, ^
 Dividing with zero naturally causes problems.
 The following operations are being included, so don't use them
 as part of names or codes:
 !, -, ~

Spelling mistakes:
 Misspellers will be punished.
 Muhahahahahahahahaaaaaaaaa!!!!1111!!!!!

-----------------------------------------------
----------------Preprocessor-------------------
-----------------------------------------------

Preprocessor is does exactly what you can deduce from the name, it
will modify the code before passing it to the actual assembler.
You can interact with preprocessor by using preprocessor commands,
which you have several at your disposal. All preprocessor commands
start with #, so they are easy to spot in code. Preprocessor is
currently only available for assembly, so you won't see preprocessor
related things in disassembled code.

Defining stuff:
 You can define a piece of text to mean something else with #define.
 First parameter is the text that you are giving meaning to and the 
 second is the real value. Note that using defined things as the
 real value causes problems. Example:
  #define Eliwood 1
 This can be then used in your code like this:
  IFCA 15 Eliwood
 The defined name must be made of letters, numbers and underscore '_'.

Definition files:
 #define file *file path* 
 The define files themselves are like this:
  0x01 Eliwood EliwoodLord IronSword
  0x02 Hector  LynLord     SlimSword
 This defines Eliwood, EliwoodLord and IronSword as values 1 and
 Hector, LynLord and SlimSword as values 2.

Undefining:
 You can use #undef to undefine something defined with
 #define. Attempting to undefine something that hasn't been defined
 is ignored.

Checking if something is defined:
 With #ifdef and #ifndef, you can check if something is defined
 or not. #endif must be used to sign an end of #if check.
 #else can be used between #if and #endif to react for opposite
 result. #if's can stack.

Automatically defined stuff:
 Event assembler automatically defines _EA_. It also defines either
 _FE6_, _FE7_ or _FE8_ depending on the selected game. Other defined
 names are _line_ and _file_ that stand for current line and file,
 respectably. Undefining or defining any of these leads to undefined 
 behaviour.

Including other files:
 Using #include *filePath* you can include extra code and 
 variable definitions from other files into this.

Including a binary file:
 You can include a binary file amongst the event assembly
 with #incbin *file path*. This will copy all data from the
 file into the part of the code where #incbin is used.

Using double quotes:
 Surrouding text with "" allows you to force them as single
 parameter for preprosessor. In the actual code, they will be 
 treated as normal characters.

Macros:
 Macros are defined like anything else, except they take parameters too.
 Example:
 #define Sieze(eventID,offset,X,Y) "LOCA eventID offset [X,Y] 0xF"
 Separate parameters are separated by , in the macro definition.
 After definition, the macro can be then used in the code like this:
  Sieze(0x20,Sieze_Your_Mom,2,33)
 And that will look to assembler like this:
  LOCA 0x20 Sieze_Your_Mom [2,33] 0x0F
 As with other defines, macros and their parameters must be made from
 letters, numbers and underscore '_'.

Adding and dumbing the pool:
 You can add codes into the pool by using AddToPool macro:
  AddToPool(code)
 Then later in code you can dump the added line with #pool.
 The AddToPool is then replaced with a label pointing to the
 dumped code.

Libraries:
 Event Assembler Standard Library contains large amount of definitions
 and macros to help you write code easier and help reduce repetition of 
 common event structures. You can include EAstdlib by including
 #include EAstdlib.event in your code. For further info, see EAstdlib.event
 file, which is just normal text file you can open in text editor.
 More libraries may be made in future, possibly by other authors.

Built-in Macros:
 There are some macros that are built into the Event Assembler itself
 instead of being part of a library. The reason is simple, they can't 
 be made any other way. These are:

  AddToPool(code)
   See: Adding and dumbing the pool
   
  IsDefined(name)
   Returns 1 if the name is currently defined, else 0.
     
  ConstVector(param1, param2, ..., paramN)
   Constructs a new vector from the parameters. Example:
    ConstVector(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)
   is processed to:
    [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
   
  DeconstVector(vector)   
   The reverse of ConstVector, it takes a vector and returns it's 
   coordinates seoparated by space. Example:
    DeconstVector([1,2,3,4,5,6,7])
   is processed to:
    1 2 3 4 5 6 7
    
  ToParameters(vector)
   Takes a vector and trims the [ and ] from it. Example:
    ToParameters([1,2,3,4,5,6,7])
   is processed to:
    1,2,3,4,5,6,7
    
  Signum(value)
   Takes a value and returns -1 if the values is negative,
   1 if it's positive and 0 if it's 0.
  
  Switch(toSwitchOn, option1, option2,...,optionN)
   Returns the option specified by the toSwitchOn.
   If toSwitchOn is 1, then it returns option1, if 2
   it returns to option2 and etc. Example:
    Switch(4, 0, 0, 0, 1337, 9001, 9001, 9001)
   is processed to:
    1337
   Attempting to access unspecified option leads
   the macro getting replaced with empty string.

Special codes
 ORG *Offset*
  Changes the current offset of assembly. Note that if 
  this isn't used, the compiler automatically starts to
  assemble the code to offset 0, which will break the 
  ROM utterly.
  
   Offset = Offset to change to. Can be either
            smaller or larger than the previous offset.
 
 CURRENTOFFSET
  Not a code, but a value that can be used as a 
  parameter by another code.
 
 MESSAGE
  Sends a message to post to Event Assembler.
 
 ERROR
  Sends a message to post as an error to Event Assembler.
 
 WARNING
  Sends a message to post as a warning to Event Assembler.
 
 {
 }
  Starts and ends a label scope. Labels defined in a scope
  are only available in child scopes.

 ALIGN *value* 
  Aligns current offset by adding to it if necessary. Most 
  codes require an alignment of 4, so if you get an error
  about offset not being divisible by a value, use ALIGN before 
  that code to fix the error.

   Value = The value to pad the offset to.
