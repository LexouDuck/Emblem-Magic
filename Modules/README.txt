This folder is meant to hold .emm "modules" (the file extension stands for Emblem Magic Module).
These are simply text files with a specific syntax, which define how to generate a GUI for a certain struct/bit of data.

You can find a more detailed explanation of how modules work, and what the syntax is, in the Help documents.
You can either open the help from within Emblem Magic, from the main window, or simply by opening the "Emblem Magic.chm" file.
