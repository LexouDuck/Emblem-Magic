This folder is meant to hold vanilla Fire Emblem GBA game ROMs, for Emblem Magic to compare against/use to generate hacks.
Get a clean ROM of the Fire Emblem GBA game you wish to edit, and place it in this folder.
Emblem Magic supports all of the GBA Fire Emblem games, in their different localized versions.
So that they can be recognized by the program, you must name your clean ROM correctly, like so:
FE6J.gba
FE7J.gba
FE7U.gba
FE7E.gba
FE8J.gba
FE8U.gba
FE8E.gba
