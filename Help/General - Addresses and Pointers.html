	<h1>Addresses and Pointers</h1>
	<p>
	Any file on a computer is a big sequence of bytes (so really just a sequence of 0s and 1s). An address is a specific location in the file, it is the number of bytes that come before said location.<br>
	We sometimes see the word 'offset' be used interchangeably with 'address', which isn't quite correct. Whereas an address refers specifically to a byte index within a file, the word offset is normally used to specify a byte index within a subsection of a file.
	<br>
	<br>
	In Emblem Magic, addresses generally are represented with 6 digits, since most Fire Emblem ROMs weigh 16MB or less, although you might see 7 digit addresses on an expanded ROM or with the PAL version of Fire Emblem 8.
	<br>
	<br>
	A pointer is an address, written in the file itself. It is a reference to a location in the file read from another place in this same file. The Game Boy Advance writes and reads numbers in Little Endian - this means all the numbers stored in the ROM are reversed byte-by-byte - and pointers are no exception.<br>
	What's more, when running, the GBA uses all the addressing space in its memory from 0x00000000 to 0x08000000 - thus, any data the GBA reads from the cartridge has its address shifted by 0x08000000, and pointers are written in the ROM with this in account.
	So, where we might write an address like "0x6AF500", a pointer to this same address would look like "00 F5 6A 08" in the ROM.
