This folder is meant to hold "Array" files: these are lists of item names, for the different data arrays in the ROM.
Some of these "arrays" are actually lists of pointers, to more easily keep track of which pointer has which data.

NB: You can choose to check the 'Use Custom Array Path' option in the Emblem Magic settings.t
Thiss will make Emblem Magic read array entry names from your own custom folder, rather than this one.
